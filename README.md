🚀 **Project Overview**  
Today, I embarked on an exciting journey to build a **Food Delivery Cost Data Analysis Project**! This project focuses on understanding the various factors affecting food delivery costs through data analysis and visualization. 

🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
I began with **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, diving deep into the dataset to uncover hidden patterns. This included:  
- 📊 **Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing values and outliers for accurate analysis.  
- 📈 **Data Visualization**: Utilizing libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful graphs.  
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between delivery costs and various features.  

🛠️ **Feature Engineering**  
Next, I focused on **Feature Engineering** to enhance the dataset:  
- ✨ **Creating New Features**: Developed additional variables, such as distance metrics and time of day.  
- 🔄 **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Used techniques like one-hot encoding to prepare data for modeling.  
- 🔍 **Feature Selection**: Implemented strategies to select the most impactful features for analysis.  

📊 **Power BI Dashboard Creation**  
To visualize the findings, I designed a comprehensive **Power BI Dashboard**:  
- 🎨 **Interactive Visuals**: Created engaging charts and graphs for user interaction.  
- 📅 **Time Series Analysis**: Incorporated a timeline to showcase cost trends over time.  
- 📍 **Geospatial Mapping**: Visualized delivery costs across different regions for geographical insights.  

📈 **Insights Gained**  
Through the analysis, I uncovered valuable insights:  
- 💰 **Cost Drivers**: Identified key factors influencing delivery costs, such as distance and order size.  
- 🕒 **Peak Times**: Recognized trends in delivery costs during peak hours.  
- 🌍 **Regional Differences**: Highlighted variations in costs based on location.  

💡 **Conclusion**  
This project not only enhanced my skills in Python, EDA, and Power BI but also deepened my understanding of the food delivery industry. I'm excited to present these findings and explore further implications!  

🔜 **Next Steps**  
Moving forward, I plan to refine the model and potentially implement machine learning techniques to predict delivery costs more accurately.
